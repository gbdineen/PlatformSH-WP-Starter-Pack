# Place any plugins that cannot be managed by Composer in this folder such as paid plugins like WooCommerce and a handful that are not in Packagist for whatever reason. Commit/Push to the repo. Composer will put them in the correct location.

# After first clean build, uncomment the relevant commands in the build: section of the .platform.app.yaml file.
# This will include the manual plugins in the build.
